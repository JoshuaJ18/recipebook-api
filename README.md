# recipebook-api

this is the backend/api used to service my Recipe Book website: 
https://bestrecipeever.netlify.app/

The frontend and backend of this website were built with the MERN stack.
This repo contains the M, E, and N of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Expressjs, Reactjs, Nodejs).

This is a RESTful api that allows for login/register functionality as well as storing the recipe information.

To see the frontend of the project please vist: https://github.com/JoshuaJ18/recipebook
